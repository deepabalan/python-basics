# Write a function triplets that takes a number n as argument and
# returns a list of triplets such that sum of first two elements of
# the triplet equals the third element using numbers below n. Please
# note that (a, b, c) and (b, a, c) represent same triplet.


def triplets(n):
    return [(x, y, z) for x in range(1, n) for y in range(x, n) for z in range(y, n) if z == x + y]


print triplets(5)
